## üëã About This Project

This repository contains a comprehensive soccer analysis system that demonstrates advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system performs real-time player tracking, team classification, tactical analysis, and database integration with professional-grade data export capabilities.

## üéØ Project Overview

The Soccer Analysis System processes soccer videos to extract detailed player tracking data, perform tactical analysis, and export comprehensive datasets. It features a split-screen interface with real-time video analysis and tactical board visualization.

## üéØ Technical Challenges Solved

This project addresses several complex computer vision challenges in sports analytics:

- **Real-time Player Tracking:** Implemented robust player tracking using YOLO and ByteTrack to maintain consistent player identification across frames
- **Team Classification:** Developed automated team classification using SigLIP feature extraction and machine learning clustering
- **Multi-coordinate Transformation:** Created coordinate transformation pipeline from video pixels to real-world pitch coordinates
- **Database Integration:** Built comprehensive PostgreSQL integration with mock database fallback for testing
- **Data Export Pipeline:** Implemented complete ETL pipeline with CSV/JSON/TXT export formats
- **Professional UI:** Developed split-screen interface with tactical board visualization and real-time progress tracking

## üíª Installation

Install the system in a [**Python>=3.8**](https://www.python.org/) environment.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ashok-sravanam/sports-optimized-.git
cd sports-optimized/examples/soccer

# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install -r tactical_requirements.txt

# Download models and sample video
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Run the analysis system
python3 test_bug_fixes.py \
    --source_video_path "video_outputs/psgVSliv.mov" \
    --target_video_path "video_outputs/analysis_output.mp4" \
    --max_frames 500 \
    --device cpu
```

## üéØ Features
