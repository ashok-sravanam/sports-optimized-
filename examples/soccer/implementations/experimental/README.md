# Experimental Implementations

## 🔬 **Advanced Features Under Development**

This folder contains experimental implementations that explore advanced features but are not yet production-ready.

## 📁 **Files**

- `soccer_analysis_final.py` - Position-based player IDs (1-11) with unified ball tracking
- `position_assignment.py` - Spatial position assignment manager (GK=1, RB=2, etc.)
- `unified_exporter.py` - Advanced unified tracking exporter
- `formation_manager.py` - Dynamic formation management system

## 🎯 **Experimental Features**

### **Position-Based Assignment**
- Assigns standard soccer positions (1-11) based on spatial location
- GK=1, RB=2, LB=3, CB_R=4, CB_L=5, CDM=6, LW=7, CM_R=8, ST=9, CM_L=10, RW=11
- Uses pitch coordinates to determine player positions
- Handles position conflicts and fallback logic

### **Dynamic Formations**
- User input for team formations (4-3-3, 4-4-2, etc.)
- Interactive formation prompts
- Command-line formation arguments
- No hardcoded formations

### **Unified Tracking**
- Players AND ball in single CSV table
- No player names, only position numbers
- Ball tracking with tracker_id=-1
- Complete coordinate transformation

## ⚠️ **Known Issues**

1. **Position Assignment**: Complex logic may assign wrong positions
2. **Referee Handling**: Needs refinement for proper filtering
3. **Confidence Thresholds**: May need tuning for accuracy
4. **Performance**: More complex than working version

## 🔧 **Development Status**

- **Position Assignment**: 🟡 In Development
- **Formation Management**: 🟡 In Development  
- **Unified Export**: 🟡 In Development
- **Testing**: 🔴 Needs More Testing

## 🚀 **Future Integration**

These experimental features may be integrated into the working version once they are fully tested and refined.
