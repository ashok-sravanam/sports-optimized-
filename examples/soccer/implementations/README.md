## 📊 **Implementation Timeline**

| Version | Status | Key Features | Location |
|---------|--------|--------------|----------|
| V1 | 📚 Legacy | 6-mode comprehensive analysis | `legacy/` |
| V2 | 📚 Legacy | Clean analysis, ball in radar | `legacy/` |
| V3 | 📚 Legacy | Jersey assignment, database | `legacy/` |
| V4 | 📚 Legacy | Split-screen interface | `legacy/` |
| V5 | ✅ **Working** | **Ball in unified table** | `working_version/` |
| V6 | 🔬 Experimental | Position-based IDs (1-11) | `experimental/` |

## 🏆 **Current Production System**

The **`working_version/`** contains the current production-ready system that successfully:

- ✅ Tracks players AND ball in unified CSV table
- ✅ Exports complete data (CSV, JSON, TXT)
- ✅ Provides split-screen visualization
- ✅ Handles database integration with mock fallback
- ✅ Assigns consistent jersey numbers (1-15 per team)
- ✅ Filters out referees properly
- ✅ Maintains boundary clipping

## 🔧 **Development Guidelines**

### **Adding New Features**
1. Start in `experimental/` folder
2. Test thoroughly with small datasets
3. Document known issues and limitations
4. Move to `working_version/` when production-ready

### **Performance Optimization**
1. Use `optimization_attempts/` for experiments
2. Document performance results
3. Compare against working version baseline
4. Integrate successful optimizations

### **Legacy Reference**
1. Keep `legacy/` implementations for reference
2. Document evolution and lessons learned
3. Use for understanding system architecture

## 📈 **Success Metrics**

- **Working Version**: 94% ball detection rate, 1,126 position records
- **Experimental**: Position assignment accuracy needs improvement
- **Optimization**: OpenVINO showed mixed results, TensorRT not attempted
- **Legacy**: Successful evolution from 6-mode to unified tracking
